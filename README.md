**Diabetes Prediction**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Diabetes_predicition.ipynb) that implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict diabetes based on patient data.

**Project Tasks:**
The notebook performs the following key tasks:

**Load Data**: The data is loaded from a CSV file named diabetes_data.csv.

**Data Pre Processing:** This involves initial exploration of the dataset, including viewing the head of the dataframe, checking its dimensions, and descriptive statistics.

**Train Test Split:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.

**Support Vector Machine Classifier:** A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is used for the classification task.

**Prediction for Diabetes:** The trained model is used to make predictions for diabetes.

**Libraries Used:**
The following Python libraries are imported and used in the notebook:

numpy (as np)

pandas (as pd)

sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split

sklearn.svm (as svm)

sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score

warnings
